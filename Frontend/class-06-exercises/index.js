//exercise 1 
    // Create three functions: one global, one as an object method, and an arrow function inside an object.
    // Print the value of this inside each function.
    // Discuss or note down the differences you observe in the value of this across the three scenarios.

//function 1: global
function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello!')
    console.log(this) //this refers to the window
}
//function 2: object method

//exercise 2-5
    // Define a Person class with properties name and age.
    // Add a method greet() to this class which outputs a greeting.
    // Instantiate two different Person objects and invoke their greet methods.
    //3
    // Modify your Person class. The constructor should now accept and initialize name and age properties.
    // Create two different Person instances with unique names and ages.
    //4
    // Add a static method called info() to the Person class. This method should return a statement like, "This is a Person class".
    // Try accessing this method both from the class itself and from an instance of the class. Document the outcomes.  
    //5
    // Within your Person class, add getters and setters for the age property.
    // Ensure with the setter that age can't be set to a negative value.
    // Instantiate a Person object, try setting a negative age, and observe the results.

//exercise 7
    // As a challenge, design a Library class. This class should be able to store book objects.
    // For book objects, you should have a Book class. This class should have private fields for ISBN and public fields like title, author, and yearPublished.
    // The Library should feature methods that allow a user to add a book, remove a book, and list all books.
    // Implement this system and run a series of operations, such as adding a book, listing books, etc.


//exercise 8
// Create a class Student with properties name and grades. Implement methods to add grades and compute the average. How does the this keyword behave differently in arrow functions compared to regular functions?
